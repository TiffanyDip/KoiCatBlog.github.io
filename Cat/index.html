    	<p>Welcome! This blog will be all about the dilute calico cat name Koi and the mischief she brings!</p>
   <section>
		<h4><font color="#FFE5B4">About Koi</h4>
		<p><font color="#808080">Koi, a dilute female calico cat, was born in July 2023. Koi is named after the colors of the koi fish however she dislikes water. She is believed to be a Turkish Angora. Playful and energetic, Koi often gets the zoomies and enjoys long naps. Despite being a cat she sound more like a dog or a bird at times.</p>
        <p>The journey to bring Koi home was quite interesting. It began with a 20-minute walk to reach the car, during which rain started pouring halfway through. Another 40 minutes were spent driving to her foster home, all the while the rain continued to pour. In a way, her name suits her, as her presence seems to bring rain wherever she goes.</font color="#808080"></p>

        <font color="#808080">Taking my cat, Koi, for her first walk with a harness was an adventure filled with curiosity, excitement, and a touch of uncertainty. Koi, however, seemed less than thrilled about the harness, casting doubt on whether our outdoor excursion was a good idea. Despite her initial reluctance, I decided to venture out with her, hoping to introduce her to the wonders of the world outside our home.

        As soon as we stepped outside, Koi's demeanor changed. She was immediately captivated by her surroundings, her senses alive with curiosity. Watching her explore was a delight; every rustle of leaves and chirp of a bird seemed to pique her interest. It was heartwarming to see her enjoy the simple pleasures of the outdoors, particularly her fascination with the grass beneath her paws.

        Despite her initial reservations, Koi's first walk with a harness turned out to be a rewarding experience. It was a joy to witness her curiosity and excitement, and it strengthened our bond in ways I had not anticipated. As we made our way back home, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to share such a special moment with my furry companion.</font color="#808080">
